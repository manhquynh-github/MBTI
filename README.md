# MBTI
The **Myersâ€“Briggs Type Indicator** (**MBTI**) is a pseudoscientific introspective self-report questionnaire indicating differing psychological preferences in how people perceive the world and make decisions. (See [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator)).

This app will guide you through a quiz of 80 questions to determine your MBTI. Additionally, you can learn more about all personality types.

The app currently supports two languages: Vietnamese (original), and English (translated). You are welcome if you'd like to contribute your own language translation by creating a new [pull request](https://github.com/manhquynh-github/MBTI/pulls) or [issue](https://github.com/manhquynh-github/MBTI/issue).
